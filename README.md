## Overview

You can view the deployed game [here](https://leithdm.github.io/milestone-project-2/).

<br/>

## UX

This project is part of the [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/) Full Stack Software Development course, specifically **Module 2: Interactive Front-End Development**. The objective for this milestone project is to "*build an interactive front-end site. The site should respond to the users' actions, allowing users to actively engage with data, alter the way the site displays the information to achieve their preferred goals.*"

Main technologies required: HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
Optional: other JavaScript libraries, external APIs.

### User Stories

- User Stories were written from the perspective of the user and the developer. 
  
<br/>

"**__As a *user*, I__** ______________________________________________"

- need to be able to view the site from any device (mobile, tablet, desktop).
- should be presented with a site that meets accessibility guidelines including contrast between background and foreground colors, and non-text elements with alt text equivalents.


<br/>

"**__As a *developer*, I__** ______________________________________________"

- must maximise future maintainability through documentation, code structure and organisation.
- must document testing fully to include evaluation of bugs found and their fixes and explanation of any bugs that are left unfixed.
- must test and deploy to a cloud platform. 
- HTML/CSS code pass through the official W3C validators with no issues.
- JavaScript code must pass through a linter with no major issues.

<br/>

### Design

The overall concept is...

<br/>


#### Color Scheme

- 

<br/>


#### Typography

- The site incorporates [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) throughout the application. The primary font selected is...

<br/>

### Wireframes
